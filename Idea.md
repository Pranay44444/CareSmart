## Project Idea

CareSmart is an AI-powered ecommerce platform that focuses on selling **device care, protection, and productivity accessories** for modern smartphones and laptops.  
Instead of repair-based solutions, the platform emphasizes **preventive care**, making it practical for sealed devices such as smartphones and MacBooks.

Users frequently face issues like overheating, slow charging, and physical damage due to incompatible or poor-quality accessories.

Existing ecommerce platforms:
